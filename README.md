# Swift Alps Networking Workshop

### Prepared with ❤️ by Florent Pillet - @fpillet

Welcome to the [Swift Alps](https://theswiftalps.com) Networking Workshop! You'll learn a lot about [Swift-NIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio), a new high performance network application framework from Apple, as well as about [Network.framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network), the new networking API in iOS 12, tvOS 12 and macOS 10.14 Mojave which deprecates most of the past networking APIs.

In this project, you will work on a chat server using Swift-NIO, and a chat client on iOS using Network.framework. You can choose to work on one or both, depending on your interest and your learning speed. Once you get back from Swift Alps, you can check out this material to learn about networking techniques using both frameworks.

I hope you'll enjoy them as much as I do!

Please check out [`ChatClient.md`](ChatClient.md) and [`ChatServer.md`](ChatServer.md) for the challenges with each project.
